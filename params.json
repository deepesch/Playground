You can find all the codes for the corresponding projects in the repository. The following is a list of the projects. When I set up to do these work, I was just a beginner of this field, so may be there are many questions remained that I have not noticed. Welcome to point them out and if you have any problems with my work welcome to contact me by e-mail:  **deepesch@gmail.com**\r\n\r\n### List of the projects.\r\n\r\n  * **[Twitter Cluster to stream](https://github.com/deepesch/deepesch.github.io/tree/master/Twitter%20Cluster%20to%20Stream)**:  \r\n      \r\n      Demo of the most common techniques used in industry from clustering to streaming.\r\n  * **Visualization libraries in Python**:\r\n      \r\n      There are many different Python plotting packages. Amoung all of the  available libraries some may suit your needs better. Some of these are interfaces to existing plotting libraries while others are Python-centered new implementations.\r\n  * **Word2Vec - Kaggle Competition**:\r\n      \r\n      Machine Learning Competition(Movie Ratings).\r\n  * **Naive Bayes Implementation**:\r\n      Natural Language Processing Project\r\n      \r\n \r\n### \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n##","google":"UA-29430630-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
