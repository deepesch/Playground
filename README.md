### Introduction

This repository is mainly used to store projects of Data Science which I have followed & worked for a period of time. You can find all the codes for the corresponding projects in the repository. The following is a list of the projects. When I set up to do these work, I was just a beginner of this field, so may be there are many questions remained that I have not noticed. Welcome to point them out and if you have any problems with my work welcome to contact me by e-mail:  **deepesch@gmail.com**
