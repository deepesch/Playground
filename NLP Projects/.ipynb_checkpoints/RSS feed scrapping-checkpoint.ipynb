      "Hillary Clinton just had the best week of her campaign yet.  Not only did she shine at the Benghazi hearing yesterday, three of her Democratic opponents dropped out of the presidential nomination race.  Joe Biden was never actually in the race, but his announcement that he wouldn't run was more significant than Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee ending their campaigns.  This leaves Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley, and Lawrence Lessig.  Of those four, only Sanders and Clinton have any chance at winning the nomination, and Hillary's doing better in the polls than Sanders.  So, all in all, a very good week for Hillary Clinton.\n",
      "Republicans are getting a little worried, as they should.  One House member from Alabama is already on the case, though, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/10/19/hillary_clinton_isnt_even_the_nominee_but_a_gop_congressman_is_already_vowing_to_impeach_her/\">warming up</a> the all-but-inevitable \"Impeach Hillary Clinton Committee.\"  No, really.  Here's what Mo Brooks had to say about Hillary Clinton: \"She will be a unique president if she is elected by the public next November, because the day she's sworn in is the day that she's subject to impeachment because she has committed high crimes and misdemeanors.\"  Good thing Republicans are planning ahead, eh?\n",
      "Speaking of Republicans planning ahead, the coronation of Paul Ryan is apparently now officially going to happen.  In a hilarious turnabout, Ryan met with the Tea Partiers and issued <em>his own list of demands to them</em>.  Shoe's on the other foot now, guys!  If you don't like Ryan making take-it-or-leave-it demands of you, perhaps you should think for <em>one tiny minute</em> about how the rest of the country feels when you do it to us.\n",
      "Ryan does not want to do all that boring fundraising that normally guarantees a hungry politician a job like speaker of the House.  He'd rather play with his kids.  And who can blame him, really?  Take the kids to a football game versus call some plutocrat and beg for a fat check?  That's a pretty easy call.  Ryan also laughably demanded that the Tea Partiers stop knifing the speaker in the back so often.  However, we seriously doubt that the Tea Partiers are going to play nice, sit down, and shut up for very long.  It's not really who they are, to state the glaringly obvious.\n",
      "There was quite a bit of marijuana news in the past week, beginning with Gallup <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/10/21/gallup-nearly-60-percent-of-americans-want-legal-marijuana/\">announcing</a> that support for outright legalization is now at 58 percent of all Americans -- the highest it has ever been.  [Pause, so you can make a \"How high is it?\" type of joke....]  Kidding aside, that's a pretty astounding amount of the country that wants our current marijuana laws to go the way of Prohibition.  Sooner or later the politicians will notice this trend, and stop being weaselly about \"supporting medical marijuana\" and just come out for full legalization.\n",
      "Speaking of politicians being weaselly about medical marijuana, we have a Chris Christie update.  Of all the candidates running for president, Christie has been most supportive of moving the country backwards in the War On Weed.  The questions he's been getting on the issue are getting a lot more specific, pointing out a basic contradiction in his political stance.  In a recent town hall in Iowa, someone has asked Christie <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/10/22/3714999/chris-christie-medical-marijuana-veteran-nurse/\">the exact question</a> I wanted to hear him answer.  A veteran asked Christie directly about the issue of marijuana being a federal Schedule I substance, defined as having \"no medicinal value.\"  Christie tried to explain that medical marijuana was somehow different because a doctor prescribes it.  The questioner pointed out that he was flat-out wrong about that: \"But under federal law, a doctor can't write a prescription. They can only recommend. Because it's a Schedule I substance. That's the problem.\"  Christie went on to -- again, wrongly -- state that the president can't change the law, Congress must act.  In fact, the attorney general can change the classification just by signing a piece of paper.  The more this issue gets raised in questions to politicians, the closer we come to actually admitting that state-level medical marijuana <em>has not changed federal law one bit</em>.  Kudos to Shelly Van Winkle for pinning down Chris Christie, who has staked out the most reactionary position of any candidate on marijuana.\n",
      "One aspect of federal law has changed for the better, and a federal judge <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medical-marijuana-ruling_56265df9e4b08589ef48fee0\">just smacked down</a> the Justice Department over its refusal to accept the new reality.  Medical marijuana providers -- even in states where it is legal by state law -- are still being persecuted by federal attorneys.  Democrat Sam Farr and Republican Dana Rohrabacher put together a bill in the House to ban this abuse of power, by zeroing out the budget for the Justice Department for any resources used to target medical marijuana operations in states where it is legal.  Federal judge Charles Breyer just confirmed that this new law means <em>exactly what it says it means</em> and that the Justice Department should just cease and desist trying to reinterpret it to mean something else.  So while medical marijuana is still a Schedule I substance and is illegal, the feds now won't be able to do anything about it in states that have changed their own laws.  This is not the perfect solution -- the law itself needs to be changed at the federal level -- but this is Congress effectively using the \"power of the purse\" to temporarily halt such persecution.  The Justice Department should not appeal this ruling, but rather they should wholeheartedly embrace the new law.\n",
      "And finally, we end this introduction with <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/10/22/idaho_agency_finds_historic_footage_of_parachuting_beavers/\">parachuting beavers</a>.  Just because.\n",

      "A case could be made for Elijah Cummings to receive this week's <strong>Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week</strong>.  Cummings has had the thankless task, for many moons now, of rebutting all the nonsense leaks that have come from the Republicans on the \"Committee To Take Down Hillary Clinton,\" pretty much ever since it started.  Cummings is the ranking Democrat on the committee, and he finally had his moment in the spotlight yesterday.\n",
      "Cummings responded to the new obsession of the Republicans on the committee over Sidney Blumenthal by demanding that Blumenthal's nine hours of testimony before the committee be made public.  After all, if Blumenthal is such a bugaboo to Republicans, there must be a reason why and that reason should be found in the questions they asked him and the answers he gave, right?  Demonizing Blumenthal doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but then nothing about the Benghazi committee makes a whole lot of sense, so it fits right in, we suppose.  Still, the vocal argument Cummings got into with Trey Gowdy was the actual highlight of yesterday's hearing.  Cummings has been saying stuff like this for a long time now, but the press has ignored him in favor of blindly reprinting the leaks from the Republicans on the committee.  Finally, Cummings got to make his case in a very public way.\n",
      "Still, even with his impressive performance yesterday, Cummings only gets an <strong>Honorable Mention</strong> this week.  Because there was someone even more impressive in that hearing.\n",
      "Without doubt, Hillary Clinton was the <strong>Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week</strong>.  Not only did three Democratic challengers fall by the wayside this week, but we finally got polling results which showed that most Democrats thought she won last week's debate.  She has reversed her slide in the polls, and is climbing back towards 50 percent support.\n",
      "And that was all before the Benghazi committee hearing.\n",
      "Hillary Clinton sat for something like 11 hours before a House committee specifically formed to do her maximum political damage.  This is the eighth major Benghazi investigation, for anyone who's keeping count, so Clinton already knew what to expect.\n",
      "What was billed as the major takedown of the strongest Democratic presidential candidate, however, did not happen as the Republicans had planned.  Clinton clearly got the better of the committee members, and provided zero fireworks and zero scandalous revelations.  As I had predicted earlier in the week, the focus was all on the questioners, and not Clinton.  Very early on, it was obvious that they had no new surprises to reveal, and that for all the noise about emails, there simply was no scandal contained within them.  Sidney Blumenthal?  That's all you got?  Wow -- can we the American taxpayers get our money back?  This investigation has dragged on far too long (so that it could schedule hearings during the presidential campaign), and spent far too much money for what we saw on display yesterday.\n",
      "Hillary rose above it all in spectacular fashion.  She never lost her cool, and provided no \"gotcha\" moments at all.  She looked, in a word, presidential.  Hillary Clinton was clearly the <strong>Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week</strong> last week.\n",
      "[<em>As a rule, we do not provide links to campaign sites, so you'll have to search Hillary Clinton's contact information yourself if you'd like to let her know you appreciate her efforts.</em>]\n",
      "&nbsp;\n",
      "In the \"too much information\" category, we have this week's <strong>Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week</strong>, former Obama aide David Axelrod felt the need <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-axelrod-barack-obama_562663b6e4b02f6a900def65\">to share with us all</a> an interesting fact.  Oh, and we warn everyone that the next paragraph contains strong language, so send the kids into the next room before you read it.\n",
      "Axelrod, in a recent interview about the time he was asked to become an official aide to President Obama, said: \"I've spent my whole life setting myself up so I could tell anybody I wanted to go fuck themselves. And I've walked out of campaigns and work situations when I thought that it wasn't right. And I said [to Obama] 'you can't say that to the president of the United States.'\"  Obama responded, according to Axelrod: \"You can tell me to fuck myself, just don't do it in front of anybody else.\"\n",
      "That's enough to disappoint people who have an ideal of the way politics is supposed to happen, and those who just don't like profanity.  But that's not what disappointed us.  It was the last line of the story which won Axelrod this week's <strong>MDDOTW</strong>: \"Axelrod didn't elaborate in the interview whether he ever actually told Obama to go fuck himself in the White House.\"\n",
      "C'mon, Dave!  If you're going to tell a story like that, you should back it up by answering the real question: did you ever do so?  In what particular circumstance?  That's more interesting than just having the green light to do so if the need arose.\n",
      "So not for what he demanded, and not for the language used, but rather for being a tease (what, are we going to have to wait for him to write a memoir to know?), David Axelrod is this week's <strong>Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week</strong>.\n",
      "[<em>David Axelrod is now a private citizen, and our longstanding policy is not to provide contact information for those not in public office.</em>]\n",

These agents still work for the D.E.A., after getting slapped on the wrist with letters of reprimand.  If Congress has a bunch of spare time to investigate things, the D.E.A. would be a dandy place to start.\"\n",

      "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Gov. Scott Walker, who has been involved in two secret John Doe investigations, signed a bill Friday doing away with the probes into political misconduct.\n",
      "The Republican-controlled Legislature this week passed the bill eliminating John Does for any kind of political misconduct, including bribes, theft and campaign finance violations. They could still be used for violent felonies and some drug crimes.\n",
      "Walker wasn't charged in either investigation involving him. The first focused on former aides and associates of Walker when he was Milwaukee County executive. Six people were convicted of a variety of crimes, including misconduct in office.\n",
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court ended the second John Doe investigation in July, saying there was nothing unconstitutional about the campaign coordination between Walker's 2012 recall committee and conservative groups.\n",
      "John Does are like a grand jury, but are done before a judge who ultimately decides whether a crime has been committed. Witnesses are under gag orders, and prosecutors can compel people to testify, obtain search warrants and collect evidence in secret.\n",
      "Republicans have denounced the second John Doe investigation into Walker and his allies as a political witch hunt and maintain that police were too heavy-handed when they executed pre-dawn search warrants.\n",
      "Republican Rep. Joe Sanfelippo of New Berlin, during debate of the measure, compared tactics used by Wisconsin law enforcement officials in executing the search warrants to Nazis. Democrats demanded an apology.\n",
      "The bill passed the Senate and Assembly with all Republicans in support and all Democrats against.\n",
      "Walker offered no comment in announcing Friday that he had signed the bill in private.\n",
      "Under the new law, even in the more limited cases where John Doe investigations are permitted, prosecutors would have to obtain permission from a majority of the state's chief judges to extend the probes beyond six months. Secrecy orders would apply only to judges, prosecutors, court officials and investigators; witnesses and suspects would be allowed to discuss such investigations openly.\n",
      "Republican backers in both the Senate and Assembly insisted the change would protect free speech rights and bring a stop to meandering investigations designed to smear prosecutors' political enemies.\n",
      "\"Wisconsin citizens should all breathe a collective sigh of relief that unconstitutional investigations that violate free speech rights are a thing of the past,\" Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said in a statement. \"These changes were desperately needed in Wisconsin and our state is better off now that it's law.\"\n",
      "Democratic Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling called the new law a \"gross abuse of political power.\"\n",
      "\"Republicans should be less concerned about covering up Gov. Walker's political scandals and more focused on helping hardworking Wisconsin families,\" Shilling said.\n",

The result will be continuing arrests and spiraling costs of enforcement.\"\n",
      "I remember when I heard something similar from <a href=\"http://www.thedailychronic.net/2012/9347/washington-marijuana-legalization-initiative-i-502-leads-in-new-poll/#comment-455178154\">No on I-502's Steve Sarich</a>: \"\"If you're happy to pay $600-$700 an ounce for 'legal' state schwag to help fund 'social services', like more law enforcement to enforce this new law, just come right out and admit it.\"\n",
      "I've toured some of the largest industrial grows in Washington and Colorado. I've never seen happier employees and cleaner grows. I've smoked their \"factory-grown schwag\" and it's dynamite. It's truly a feat of logical contortion to fear monger about the \"schemers\" who are \"all about the money\" who would then set up sub-standard operations to produce an inferior product that would be beaten out by the black market (and the thousands of home growers) and blow their investment.\n",
      "No, the real fear Wirtshafter is voicing is that of the black market growers who know they cannot compete with the price, selection, and quality of a legalized market. Even in Colorado and Washington, getting into the growing-at-scale game takes a lot of money. At least Wirtshafter is honest about the amendment initially establishing grow right for ten properties, not \"ten growers\". That deceit has been difficult to maintain since many of the landowners have signed agreements to lease parcels for independent growers.\n",
      "Then Wirtshafter follows with the <b>It's Etched In Granite Warning</b>, which is always funny when we're talking about <i>an amendment</i>. \"The Ohio Legislature has no power to repair the onerous provisions of this power grab,\" writes Wirtshafter. \"The only way to fix Issue 3 is another constitutional amendment.\"\n",
      "So, the legislature had no power to fix Issue 3 after 2015, but somehow, they had the power this year to put the Issue 2 amendment on the ballot to completely invalidate Issue 3. What, then, is stopping the legislature in 2016 from putting forth an amendment to fix Issue 3?\n",
      "Ah, yes, the power of the \"monopoly\". \"With Issue 3's backers making their projected hundreds of millions of dollars per year,\" Wirtshafter predicts, \"they will be able to spend whatever is necessary to prevent Ohio citizens from removing their stranglehold over Ohio's production.\" So, the money-grubbing cartel, which is losing money hand-over-fist because people would rather buy non-pesticide, non-bug, non-mildew, non-schwag from the black market, will spend massive amounts of money to keep the stranglehold they don't have. And the people who hate this arrangement will be swayed by their ad buys. OK...\n",
      "Then there's the <b>Only That Much Marijuana Isn't Enough Ploy</b>. Here, Wirtshafter argues that Ohio Issue 3's \"Four plants and eight ounces is not enough\" for home growing and that getting a license to home grow will be forcing citizens to \"grant permission for government inspections of their homes.\"\n",
      "Nothing in the amendment authorizes home inspections. Rather, like other states that allow home growing for all adults or for medical purposes, it requires \"homegrown marijuana is not grown or consumed within public view and that home-growing takes place in an enclosed, locked space inaccessible to persons under the age of 21.\"\n",
      "Then Wirtshafter doubles down on the <b>Illegal Non-Store Ounce Lie</b>, writing, \"Only monopoly marijuana contained in its original, sealed container is legal outside your home,\" and that \"I doubt felony arrests and costs for legal enforcement will go down under Issue 3.\" That reminds me of when <a href=\"http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2012/10/voters_should_hold_out_for_real_marijuana_reform.php\">No on I-502's Douglas Hiatt</a> foretold, \"The 10,000 possession arrests per year can easily be converted into 10,000 (or more) DUI arrests.\" (By the way, that didn't even come close to happening.)\n",
      "Finally, Wirtshafter weakly bats away the fact that Issue 3 will provide relief for hundreds of thousands of medical marijuana patients, with not only a medicine that won't be taxed and must be sold at the lowest wholesale cost, but with protection for administering medical marijuana at work that no other state provides. \"Issue 3 pandering itself as medical has split the pro-cannabis community,\" Wirtshafter intones. \"Some people are so desperate for freedom that they are willing to give up all rights to a new master.\"\n",
      "Or, maybe, just maybe, some parents are hoping the old-school Yippies don't blow this chance at getting some CBD oil for their dying epileptic daughter because a \"long-time leader in cannabis reform\" is upset that winning elections costs money these days.\n",

      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Regardless of whether these investigations are focused on uncovering facts or pursuing a political agenda, we will continue to share the facts with all of these committees, which include that fetal tissue donation for medical research is an important but tiny part of Planned Parenthood's work in just two states, that we've had guidance in place for more than a decade that goes well beyond the legal requirements, and that even doctored and discredited videos show no wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood,” said Eric Ferrero, the organization’s vice president for communications.</span>\n",

      "A series of legal changes starting in 2004 has effectively eliminated birthright citizenship in the Dominican Republic.

      "Federal agents who illegally detain, interrogate and torture American citizens abroad can't be held accountable for violating the Constitution.\n",
      "A divided federal appeals court on Friday tossed the lawsuit of a U.S.&nbsp;citizen who claimed the FBI trampled his rights for four months across three African countries while he was traveling overseas.\n",
      "In so many words, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the man, Amir Meshal,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/E8CAF3B08FAA9E8185257EE7004E2D02/$file/14-5194.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">couldn't sue the federal government</a>&nbsp;for such violations, and punted the issue to someone else.\n",
      "\"If people like Meshal are to have recourse to damages for alleged constitutional violations committed during a terrorism investigation occurring abroad, either Congress or the Supreme Court must specify the scope of the remedy,\" Judge Janice Rogers Brown wrote for the 2-to-1 court.\n",
      "Meshal's case had drawn support from a number of <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Meshal-Pfander-et-al-Amicus.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">law professors, </a>along with <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Special-Rapporteurs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">present and former</a>&nbsp;United Nations special rapporteurs on torture, who had hoped the court would help clarify when the U.S. can be made to answer for abuses abroad.\n",
      "At issue in the case was a 1971 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/388\" target=\"_blank\">Bivens v. Six Unknown Unnamed Agents</a>,&nbsp;which found for the first time that the Constitution allows citizens to hold liable federal officials who violate their rights&nbsp;-- even if Congress hadn't expressly passed a law to that effect.\n",
      "&nbsp;In subsequent decisions, however, Bivens liability has been greatly narrowed by the Supreme Court, and even more by lower courts interpreting those decisions.\n",
      "In Friday's ruling,&nbsp;the D.C. Circuit recognized the current legal landscape and noted it simply couldn't be extended to the \"unconventional context\" of Meshal's case -- a criminal investigation occurring abroad focused on alleged terrorist activity. This meant that his claims had to be dismissed.\n",
      "\"To our knowledge,\" <a href=\"https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/E8CAF3B08FAA9E8185257EE7004E2D02/$file/14-5194.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Rogers wrote</a>, \"no court has previously extended Bivens to cases involving either the extraterritorial application of constitutional protections or in the national security domain, let alone a case implicating both&nbsp;--&nbsp;another signal that this context is a novel one.\"\n",
      "Indeed, all of this may very well be too new for judges to grapple with. And one of Rogers' main rationales for rejecting Meshal's suit is that courts are ill-equipped to dabble in the \"sensitivities\" of national security and foreign policy matters, where the political branches of government occupy the field.\n",
      "Courts are \"generally not suited to second-guess executive officials operating in foreign justice systems,\" the judge wrote.\n",
      "But the court's recounting of Meshal's story seemed to offer its own counterargument.&nbsp;As told by the court, Meshal's case painted a picture of government overreach and egregious constitutional violations&nbsp;-- allegations that Rogers herself acknowledged were \"quite troubling.\"\n",
      "As outlined in his lawsuit and court filings, Meshal took a trip to Somalia in 2006,&nbsp;where he hoped to \"broaden his understanding of Islam\" following a period of political instability in the country. Instead, Meshal encountered a climate of violence and hostility that forced him to flee to Kenya, where a coalition of U.S., Kenyan and Ethiopian forces captured him.\n",
      "That's when things became turbulent for Meshal. Among other abuses, he claimed FBI agents for months held him without process or access to counsel,&nbsp;put him in solitary confinement, and threatened him with torture, death and extradition to Israel or Egypt -- where others \"had ways of making him talk\" or disappear.\n",
      "What the FBI agents wanted, according to Meshal, was for him to confess a supposed terrorist connection to al Qaeda. If he relented, FBI agents promised \"he would be returned to the United States to face civilian courts.\" But after multiple transfers to squalid jails in several countries, the agents gave up their efforts and returned Meshal to the U.S.&nbsp;By then, he had lost 80 pounds.\n",
      "No criminal charges were ever brought against him. So he sued.\n",
      "On Friday, the Washington appeals court dismissed Meshal's case, based in large part on the view that the law offers him no help, and that courts are in no position to intervene -- absent congressional or Supreme Court approval -- where national security and foreign policy interests are at stake.\n",
      "To Judge Nina Pillard, who dissented in the case, these \"unspecified concerns\" are precisely the reason courts should get involved in a case like this.&nbsp;Judges, after all,&nbsp;have \"a particular responsibility to assure the vindication of constitutional interests\" in the face of official misconduct -- especially with increased U.S. involvement abroad.\n",
      "\"Government is most tempted to disregard individual rights during times of exigency,\" Pillard wrote. \"Presented with cases involving assertions of paramount national interests in apparent tension with individual liberty, the federal courts have proved competent to adjudicate. Removing all consequence for violation of the Constitution treats it as a merely precatory document.\"\n",
      "That's near the beginning of Pillard's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/E8CAF3B08FAA9E8185257EE7004E2D02/$file/14-5194.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">lengthy and compelling dissent</a>, where she outlines reasons why the government's fears about courts hearing delicate national security matters are overblown in light of Meshal's interest in airing out his constitutional claims.\n",
      "The federal government has \"given no reason to believe that the tools available to courts to respond to such concerns would be inadequate in Meshal’s case,\" Pillard said.\n",
      "Her reasoning closely aligns with one scholar's view that the Meshal case may be \"<a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/11784/meshal/\" target=\"_blank\">the last, best hope</a>\" for breathing new life into Bivens, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/388\" target=\"_blank\">the 1971 case</a>&nbsp;with almost no teeth in these kinds of cases.\n",
      "For Pillard, that case remains more vital than ever.&nbsp;\n",
      "\"United States law enforcement is more active internationally today than ever before, increasing the relevance of Bivens' remedial and deterrent functions in cases like this one,\" she wrote.\n",

      "\"Frequently the women haven’t had very much in the way of a science education because they may well have dropped science at 16. That is just a fact,\" Averil Macdonald, a professor of science engagement at the University of Reading and chairwoman of U.K. Onshore Oil and Gas, told British newspaper <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/science/article4593941.ece\" target=\"_blank\">The Times</a>.&nbsp;\n",
      "“Women do not tend to have continued with science. Not only do [they] show more of a concern about fracking, they also know that they don't know and they don't understand. They are concerned because they don't want to be taking [something] on trust. And that's actually entirely reasonable,\" she said.\n",
      "Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is the process of injecting a mixture of chemicals, sand and highly pressurized water into rock to extract oil and natural gas. The technique is <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/182075/americans-split-support-fracking-oil-natural-gas.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">highly controversial</a> in the United States, and environmental groups have raised concerns over how the process may impact drinking water and other natural resources.&nbsp;\n",
      "The British government <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-33975798\" target=\"_blank\">recently opened up</a>&nbsp;certain areas in England for oil and gas exploration, including fracking. The idea appears to be just as controversial in the U.K. as it is in the U.S.: A <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/05/19/opposition-fracking-britain-grows/\" target=\"_blank\">YouGov poll</a> released in April found 43 percent of British people were opposed to fracking, while 32 percent supported it.\n",

That's because women are more likely to rely on \"gut reaction\" rather than facts, according to Macdonald.\n",
      "\"Why are men persuaded? That’s because an awful lot of facts have been put forward,\" she <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/science/article4593941.ece\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"[Men] will say, 'fair enough, [I] understand.' But women, for whatever reason, have not been persuaded by the facts.\"\n",

      "Anniversaries tend to draw attention when they celebrate happy events. This week marks the 21st anniversary of the United States' ratification of the<a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx\" target=\"_hplink\"> UN Convention Against Torture</a>, which obligated the U.S. under national and international law to; first and foremost, never engage in acts of torture; to thoroughly investigate violations of those rights; to bring perpetrators to justice, irrespective of level or rank; and to provide redress, including the right to rehabilitation, for survivors of torture. As I reflect on this anniversary and what it means at its core, I find myself taking note of how far we've come in our efforts to eradicate torture--and how far we've yet to go. \n",
      "On his second day in office, President Obama signed an Executive Order ensuring all U.S. interrogations were lawful and humane. He also welcomed making public a summary of the CIA Torture Report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence last November, which was an important step in helping the public have a thorough understanding of how extensively the United States condoned and inflicted torture after the attacks of 9/11. But the president has not been a strong advocate for thoroughly investigating torture committed by the United States. \n",
      "Perhaps the most critical failure has been in the area of impunity for torture. Throughout his two terms, President Obama has steadfastly ignored U.S. obligations under the Torture Convention to hold accountable those responsible by repeatedly invoking the need to turn the page on this sordid chapter of contemporary history by  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/us/politics/12inquire.html?_r=1\" target=\"_hplink\">looking forward, not backward</a>. Such impunity is not only an abrogation of U.S. requirements, it sends a disastrous message to other governments who have utilized torture as an instrument of state policy: that those who are responsible for torture--from those who provided the \"legal\" justifications, to those who ordered or authorized its use, to those who carried it out--will not be held accountable.  \n",
      "This week, former Vice President Walter Mondale emphasized the importance of a human rights approach to our national security policy. Mondale spoke with conviction, clarity and principle about the need for Congressional oversight of intelligence activities, while chiding President Obama for not holding the CIA accountable for hacking into computers used by Senate staffers investigating torture committed by the CIA post 9/11. In an interview this week on this subject, Mr. Mondale told the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/19/walter-mondale-says-full-senate-torture-report-should-be-released/\" target=\"_hplink\">Washington Post</a>, \"I'm surprised by the president, who was a distinguished scholar, a constitutional lawyer, president of the Harvard Law Review....He knows what these issues are, but he's not been a strong advocate, to put it mildly, toward requiring accountability. I agree with most of the things this president does; I do not agree with this.\"\n",
      "The former VP spoke with high credibility on this matter. In the Senate, he was a key member of the Church Committee, which investigated abuses by the CIA, the NSA and the FBI after Watergate, including attempts to assassinate foreign leaders. The Committee's work led to policies banning assassinations of foreign leaders through Executive orders issued by Presidents Ford and Reagan. It also led to the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The Committee's work and revelations, and the Executive Orders which followed, are important examples of the government taking steps to increase oversight and minimize the possibility that such abuses would be repeated in the future.\n",
      "As I contemplate this anniversary, I find there are serious steps to be taken to end torture, including increased transparency and oversight, but also fully investigating credible allegations of abuse, prosecuting those who authorized, ordered or engaged in acts of torture as part of counterterrorism efforts and providing torture survivors an effective right to a remedy. I (and scores of others) staunchly believe the Senate Intelligence Committee's torture report must be released in full, to allow full transparency into the United States' actions. The prison at Guantanamo Bay must be closed once and for all, and end its abhorrent practice of indefinite detention without charge or trial. \n",

      "\tOur first government under the Articles of Confederation was scarcely a government at all. It was actually a little more than a social gathering among representatives of the sovereign states. It could not impose taxes, but only request financial support from the states which was never enough to keep the Revolutionary Army fed and clothed. It soon became clear that our government was a government in name only.\n",
      "\tBut there were a few extraordinary individuals at large who realized that the ineffectual government they had created was a recipe for anarchy. If a government is to govern, it must have power - to collect taxes, set foreign policy, maintain an army and navy and generally attend to the public interests. Among those who felt this way were James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and, of course, George Washington. \n",
      "\tThere was a long-running debate between these people and other like-minded leaders and the small government advocates who perceived a devious plot underway. Madison, Hamilton and Jay co-authored a series of publications called The Federalist Papers that laid out their rationale for advocating a strong central government - still worth a read. \n",
      "\tEventually, the Federalists prevailed in large measure because they counted George Washington among their number. Washington did not talk a lot. He was not as articulate, erudite and well educated as some of his contemporaries. But he understood the principles at stake and his force of character was sufficient to determine the outcome.\n",
      "Even so, the concerns about tyranny were reflected in the Constitution -- a government with divided powers to prevent any group or individual from becoming tyrannical. The conservatives who are today so determined to impose their vision on our government might do well to pause and consider the context of what they are attempting to do. To make the changes they want to make, it isn't enough to have working majorities in both Houses of Congress. The original tea party people saw to that. To make the changes they want, the conservatives need the White House too, and to win the Presidency they must demonstrate their ability to govern sensibly. Shutting down the government now would not serve their cause. \n",

      "We're experiencing a seismic shift in American healthcare, transitioning from a system that encourages care in high volume to one that assures we get better value for our dollars spent.  This makes sense.  After all, the United States spends more on healthcare than any other nation on the planet, so we should be getting more bang - in the form of better health outcomes and population well-being - for the buck.\n",
      "This is easier said than done, however.  The trick to injecting greater value into the healthcare system lies in finding the right balance between competing perspectives.  Those who pay for healthcare - be they private insurers or public payers like Medicare - find value in steps that reduce medical costs, particularly in the short term.  For patients, new treatments and technologies that improve health, reduce the likelihood of disability and enable longer, high-quality lives hold great value.  Sometimes, these objectives align.  Often, though, it's more complicated and the secret lies in finding the sweet spot that promotes both significant health gains and financial sustainability.\n",
      "And we have a responsibility to raise questions about actions and decisions that may fail to strike that necessary balance.  Decisions about the evidence to consider and the weight applied to conflicting evidence can lead to different conclusions, and understanding the perspective of the reviewer sheds light on the reasons behind these judgment calls.\n",
      "There has been an increased spotlight of late on the Institute of Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), which has received a hefty infusion of grant money for its work evaluating the cost-effectiveness of medical tests, treatments and delivery system innovations.  Ostensibly, ICER's research and recommendations are intended to help guide decision-making on the value of medical innovations, which can affect coverage and patient access.  \n",
      "When patient lives and health are at stake, it's vital that we evaluate the evaluators like ICER and better understand the priorities that guide the advice they provide.  Let's consider the current subject of a preliminary ICER analysis, the CardioMEMS HF system.  This is a new medical device that, once implanted in an appropriately indicated heart failure patient, provides real-time data on pressure changes within the heart.  This enables a physician to make treatment adjustments to avoid the health problems that frequently lead to hospital readmissions (heart failure, the leading cause of readmissions among Medicare patients, is a primary target for reducing avoidable hospitalizations). Data presented recently at the 2015 American College of Cardiology annual scientific session shows the technology reduces cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization and readmission rates among certain heart failure patients.  \n",
      "ICER's draft analysis includes recommendations though that raises questions as to whether this innovation will be accessible to patients. In making its recommendations, ICER places greater weight on an FDA Advisory Panel's questions than the FDA's final decision in granting market approval and, although mentioning some private insurers' medical policies, omits Medicare's favorable reimbursement decisions that require finding a \"substantial clinical improvement\" over standard practice. Additionally, ICER even provided more weight on the FDA Advisory Panel than the five published, peer-reviewed publications that had their highest rating possible.  These judgment calls led to conclusions regarding the benefit the technology may have to alternative management options for patients with congestive heart failure.\n",
      "This raises questions on ICER's methods. The organization places a strong emphasis on cost - evaluating the short-term price tag of a new technology balanced against the offset gained by other medical cost savings.  It doesn't take into consideration the clinical judgment of providers (in fact it's not clear at all whether ICER consults with any healthcare providers or patients with actual experience using the technologies under review), nor does it include consideration of Medicare's review of the evidence in its reimbursement determinations that found the CardioMEMS HF device represents a \"substantial clinical improvement\" over existing treatments and granting incremental payment. Likewise, it considers opinions of an FDA Advisory Panel over the published, peer-reviewed publications and FDA's actual determination that the technology as safe and effective for commercial use when evaluating all the evidence available. These are critical omissions. And what results is a limited spectrum of evidence that casts aside or simply does not seek much of the relevant information available, which then leads to a recommendation that could deny a new heart care option to heart disease patients and their doctors.  \n",
      "The purpose of my commentary isn't to make a case for any particular medical device.  Rather, I hope it serves as a cautionary tale about the way we make this very necessary transition from volume-based healthcare to a value-focused system.  Ideally, this shift toward value will bring about a healthcare environment that does more while costing less.  Realistically, however, we can't afford to focus so intensely on cost savings that quality takes a distant back seat.  The cautionary tale involving CardioMEMS HF highlights the pitfalls in using short-term cost as a final word on value that can improve lives and save dollars in the long run.  It also demonstrates the need to understand how decisions on evidence to consider can affect the end result.\n",

      "Asked if a meeting next week could include Iran, Kerry said he would not speculate on who might attend. But he added: \"We want to be inclusive and err on the side of inclusivity rather than exclusivity.\"\n",
      "Iran has not been invited to previous international peace conferences on Syria, all of which ended in failure, while the war, which has so far killed more than 250,000 people and driven millions from their homes, has raged on.\n",
      "There is a strong correlation between the fact that Iran has been excluded and the fact that previous efforts have failed. If you want to end a war through negotiations, the key parties involved in the war have to be at the table - isn't that obvious? As Jeremy Shapiro of Brookings <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/10/22/450937820/foreign-ministers-to-meet-in-vienna-discuss-syria\" target=\"_hplink\">told <em>NPR</em></a>:\n",
      "A. SHAPIRO (Host): One important party is not at the negotiating table in Vienna, and that is Iran. Can any kind of a solution be reached without Iranian involvement?\n",
      "J. SHAPIRO: I don't think so. I think that the Iranians are too important on the ground in Syria. They have too much influence with the Assad regime and the various militias that are supporting it, and they have too much capacity to spoil any agreement that has been made without them. I think that whether we like it or not, if we're going to have a political settlement to the Syrian civil war, the Iranians need to be part of it.\n",
      "UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34378889\" target=\"_hplink\">said</a> during the UN General Assembly that five countries are key to a political solution: the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran. As the <em>BBC</em> reported at the time:\n",
      "UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said five countries - Russia, the US, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran - were key to finding a political solution in Syria, but unless they could compromise, it would be \"futile\" to expect change on the ground.\n",
      "Why was Iran excluded from the Vienna meeting? Because Saudi Arabia said so, apparently. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir <a href=\"https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/saudi-arabia-envisions-no-iran-role-ending-crisis-061346565.html\" target=\"_hplink\">said Monday</a> it was difficult to envision a role for Iran in ending the war due to Iran's military role in the conflict. That, of course, makes no sense at all. The other countries the Secretary General named - the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - have a military role in the conflict. That's why they're crucial to a solution. Saudi Arabia doesn't want Iran to participate because Saudi Arabia doesn't want Iran to have a say in the resolution. That's the same as saying that you want to keep the war going.  \n",
      "The notion that the U.S. should defer to the Saudi monarch's insistence on excluding Iran, despite the fact that Iran is almost universally acknowledged to be crucial to a political solution, recalls what President Bill Clinton <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/perfect-english-or-not-netanyahu-shares-no-common-language-with-obama-1.269819\" target=\"_hplink\">reportedly said</a> in 1996 after his first meeting with then (and now) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:\n",
